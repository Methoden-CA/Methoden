        <p>
          I was a professor at the Université du Québec en Outaouais for over twenty-five years, where I developed in-depth expertise in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research methodology. Since my doctoral studies, I have focused on the complementarity of these approaches and integrated them into my teaching at the graduate level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I have contributed to scholarly publications, led funded research projects, and supervised graduate students (master’s and doctoral).
        </p>
        <p>
          As a methodological consultant, I have supported university research teams in the natural sciences, health sciences, and social sciences, helping them enhance their methodological approach, data collection instruments, and analyses. I have also provided advanced methodological training to organisational teams and collaborated on projects related to the design of data collection tools and the analysis of organisational data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also designed <strong>TeamPulse</strong>, a diagnostic tool assessing team and project dynamics, for <a href="https://www.stpginc.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St-Pierre, Gauthier & Co., Inc.</a> — a consulting firm I co-own and where I serve as Senior Consultant. St-Pierre, Gauthier & Co., Inc. supports organisations in preventing psychosocial risks and promoting healthy, safe, and respectful work environments.
