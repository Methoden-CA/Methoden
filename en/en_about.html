        <p>
          I served for over twenty-five years as a professor at the Université du Québec en Outaouais, developing expertise in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research methodology. Since my doctoral studies, I have focused on the complementarity of these approaches, integrating them into my graduate teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I have contributed to peer-reviewed publications, led funded research projects, and supervised graduate students (master’s and doctoral). As a methodological consultant, I have supported university research teams as well as organisational teams in strengthening methodological rigour, instrument design, and data collection and analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also co-developed <strong>TeamPulse</strong>, a diagnostic tool assessing team and project dynamics, for <a href="https://www.stpginc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St-Pierre, Gauthier & Co., Inc.</a> — a consulting firm I co-own and where I act as Senior Consultant. St-Pierre, Gauthier & Co., Inc. supports organisations in preventing psychosocial risks and promoting healthy, safe work environments.
